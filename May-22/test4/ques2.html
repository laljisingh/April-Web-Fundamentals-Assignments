    <!-- Whenever we declare a variable without assigning any value to it, javascript implicitly assigns its value as undefined. Null essentially represents a non-existent or an empty value i.e. we explicitly tell javascript interpreter that the variable has no value.A not defined is a variable which is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword like var, let or const. then its show the output undefined. -->
    <script>
      let a = 5; //defined
      let b = null; //null value
      let c; //undefined
      console.log(a);
      document.write(a + "<br>");
